# Refactoring `main.rs`

This document outlines the steps taken to refactor `main.rs` in the `candle-examples/examples/mamba-trainer` directory. The goal of this refactoring is to improve code organization, readability, and maintainability without altering the program's behavior.

## Refactoring Steps

1. **Move Imports:**
   - Move all `use` statements to the top of the file, grouping them together for better readability.

2. **Define `Trainer` Struct:**
   - Move the `Trainer` struct definition to the top of the file, before the `main` function.
   - This makes the `Trainer` struct more prominent and easier to understand.

3. **Organize `Trainer` Methods:**
   - Move all methods associated with the `Trainer` struct inside the struct definition.
   - This improves code organization and makes it easier to see all the methods related to the `Trainer` struct.

4. **Move Enum and Struct Definitions:**
   - Move the definitions of `Which`, `Args`, and `lbfgs_state` to the top of the file, outside of the `Trainer` struct.
   - This makes these definitions more visible and accessible.

5. **Simplify `main` Function:**
   - Remove unnecessary comments from the `main` function.
   - Refactor the `main` function to focus solely on the training loop and final generation.

6. **Move Helper Function:**
   - Move the `lines_from_file` helper function to the top of the file, outside of the `Trainer` struct.
   - This makes the helper function more accessible and reusable.

## Result

The refactored `main.rs` file is more organized, readable, and maintainable. The code is easier to understand and navigate, and the changes do not affect the program's behavior.
